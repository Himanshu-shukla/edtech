    content: `# Cybersecurity Fundamentals: Protecting Your Digital Assets

In today's interconnected world, cybersecurity is not just an IT concern—it's everyone's responsibility. Understanding cybersecurity fundamentals is crucial for professionals across all industries.

## Understanding Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These attacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information.

### Core Principles (CIA Triad):
1. **Confidentiality**: Ensuring information is only accessible to authorized parties
2. **Integrity**: Maintaining accuracy and completeness of data
3. **Availability**: Ensuring information and resources are available when needed

## Common Cyber Threats

**Types:**
- **Viruses**: Self-replicating code that attaches to other programs
- **Worms**: Standalone malware that spreads across networks
- **Trojans**: Malware disguised as legitimate software
- **Ransomware**: Encrypts data and demands payment for decryption
- **Spyware**: Secretly monitors user activities

### 2. Phishing Attacks
Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by impersonating trustworthy entities.

**Common Types:**
